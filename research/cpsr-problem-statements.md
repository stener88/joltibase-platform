---

## Instructions for Use

### Step 1: Choose Your Joltibase Statements (Pick 2-3)

Don't include all 4 Joltibase variations in one survey - it will be too obvious and dilute votes. Instead:

**Option A: Test design speed + quality**
- Include: 1A (Design Time) + 1B (Design Quality)
- Hypothesis: Time is the burning pain

**Option B: Test template confidence**
- Include: 1C (Template Starting Point) + 1D (Design Skills)
- Hypothesis: Lack of design confidence is the pain

**Option C: Test all variations (Round 2 only)**
- If Round 1 shows promise, test all 4 to find best vocabulary

### Step 2: Include All Peripheral Statements

Add all 11 peripheral problem statements to give context and competition.

### Step 3: Randomize Order

Most survey tools can randomize problem order. Enable this to prevent order bias.

### Step 4: Allow Custom Additions

Include a text field: "Don't see your biggest frustration? Add it here:"

## Core Joltibase Problem Statements

### 1A: Design Time ⭐ (RECOMMENDED - Start here)

```
Creating beautiful, professional-looking email designs takes too long when I'm trying to launch campaigns quickly.
```

**Why test this:**
- Directly addresses speed value prop
- Specific and measurable ("too long")
- Emotional trigger ("trying to launch quickly")

**Customer vocabulary detected:**
- "takes too long"
- "professional-looking"
- "launch quickly"

**If this ranks high:** Messaging should emphasize speed: "Create pro emails in minutes, not hours"

---

### 1B: Design Quality ⭐ (RECOMMENDED - Include with 1A)

```
My email designs look amateur compared to big brands, even though I spend hours trying to make them look good.
```

**Why test this:**
- Addresses quality/polish value prop
- Includes effort paradox ("spend hours" but still looks bad)
- Social comparison ("compared to big brands")

**Customer vocabulary detected:**
- "look amateur"
- "big brands"
- "trying to make them look good"

**If this ranks high:** Messaging should emphasize professional results: "Brand-quality emails, no designer needed"

---

### 1C: Template Starting Point

```
Starting from a blank canvas is overwhelming - I waste time staring at templates wondering which one will convert best.
```

**Why test this:**
- Addresses "AI picks optimal template" value prop
- Decision paralysis angle
- Conversion-focused language

**Customer vocabulary detected:**
- "overwhelming"
- "waste time"
- "which one will convert"

**If this ranks high:** Messaging should emphasize AI guidance: "AI picks the perfect template for your campaign goal"

---

### 1D: Design Skills Gap

```
I don't have design skills, so my emails never look as polished as I want them to, no matter which tool I use.
```

**Why test this:**
- Addresses visual editor value prop
- Tool-agnostic frustration (they've tried multiple)
- Self-awareness of skills gap

**Customer vocabulary detected:**
- "don't have design skills"
- "never look as polished"
- "no matter which tool"

**If this ranks high:** Messaging should emphasize accessibility: "Beautiful emails, zero design skills required"

---

## Peripheral Problem Statements

These problems compete with Joltibase's value prop. Include ALL of them in your survey.

### 2: Content Strategy

```
I never know what content to send to my email list - I struggle with ideas for every campaign.
```

**Why include:**
- Pre-design phase problem
- Could rank higher than design problems
- If ranks #1: Consider adding AI content suggestions to Joltibase

**Competitive context:**
- This is what many AI writing tools solve
- If this ranks high, design speed might not matter if they can't decide what to send

---

### 3: Sending Frequency Fear

```
I'm afraid to email my list too often and lose subscribers, so I procrastinate and send campaigns infrequently.
```

**Why include:**
- Psychological/strategic problem
- Common among creators/solopreneurs
- Could indicate that workflow problems are less important than confidence problems

**Competitive context:**
- No major tool solves this directly
- If ranks high, might indicate need for send frequency recommendations

---

### 4: Audience Segmentation

```
My email list is one big group, but I know different subscribers want different content and I don't know how to segment effectively.
```

**Why include:**
- Mid-funnel sophistication problem
- More strategic than design
- Tests whether segment is ready for advanced features

**Competitive context:**
- ConvertKit, ActiveCampaign focus on segmentation
- If ranks high, design tools are commodity - segmentation is differentiator

---

### 5: Copywriting (Click Rates)

```
Writing compelling email copy that gets people to click is harder than I expected - my open rates are decent but click rates are low.
```

**Why include:**
- Post-design optimization problem
- Results-focused (they're measuring success)
- Tests whether copy or design is bigger pain

**Competitive context:**
- AI copywriting tools (Copy.ai, Jasper) solve this
- If ranks high, consider adding AI copy suggestions to Joltibase

---

### 6: A/B Testing Confusion

```
I want to A/B test my emails to improve performance, but setting up tests is confusing and I don't know what to test.
```

**Why include:**
- Advanced user problem
- Tests technical sophistication of segment
- Could indicate design is solved, optimization is the frontier

**Competitive context:**
- Most tools have A/B testing, but setup is complex
- If ranks high, simpler A/B testing could be differentiator

---

### 7: Technical Setup (Tedium)

```
The technical setup for email campaigns (merge tags, UTM tracking, etc.) is tedious and I make mistakes that embarrass me.
```

**Why include:**
- Execution/detail problem
- Tests whether "getting it done" is bigger pain than design
- Emotional component ("embarrass me")

**Competitive context:**
- Most tools don't solve this well
- If ranks high, templates with pre-built tracking might differentiate

---

### 8: Platform Switching

```
I've switched email platforms 2-3 times trying to find the right fit, and migrating contacts/campaigns is a nightmare every time.
```

**Why include:**
- Ecosystem lock-in problem
- Indicates dissatisfaction with current tools
- These are your most likely switchers

**Competitive context:**
- Every platform has migration tools, but they all suck
- If ranks high, migration experience could be differentiator

---

### 9: Pricing Anxiety

```
Email platform pricing grows too fast as my list grows - I hit expensive tiers before I'm making enough revenue from email.
```

**Why include:**
- Economic problem (common among bootstrappers)
- Could rank higher than any feature problem
- Tests price sensitivity of segment

**Competitive context:**
- This is Mailchimp's biggest complaint
- If ranks #1: Pricing model might matter more than features
- Consider: Flat-rate pricing regardless of list size?

---

### 10: Deliverability Mystery

```
I don't understand why some of my emails land in spam folders, and troubleshooting deliverability issues is overwhelming.
```

**Why include:**
- Infrastructure problem (not design/content)
- Technical sophistication indicator
- Tests whether fundamentals trump design

**Competitive context:**
- Requires email infra expertise (SPF/DKIM/warm-up)
- If ranks high, Joltibase needs rock-solid deliverability before worrying about AI design

---

### 11: List Growth

```
Growing my email list is slow - I don't have enough high-converting lead magnets or opt-in strategies.
```

**Why include:**
- Pre-email problem (before they even send)
- Common solopreneur pain point
- Tests whether design matters if list is small

**Competitive context:**
- Lead magnet builders, landing page tools solve this
- If ranks #1: Consider whether Joltibase should include lead magnet templates
- Or: Accept that list growth tools are separate category

---

### 12: Analytics Interpretation

```
I get data from my email platform (opens, clicks, etc.) but I don't know how to interpret it or what actions to take.
```

**Why include:**
- Post-send optimization problem
- Indicates sophistication (measuring but not acting)
- Tests data-driven user segment

**Competitive context:**
- Most tools show data, few suggest actions
- If ranks high: AI-powered insights ("Your subject lines are too long - 67% of high-performers use <40 chars") could differentiate

## Analysis Shorthand

After you run the survey, use this shorthand to quickly categorize results:

**If problems #1-3 are:**
- **All design:** Joltibase is validated (design is the burning pain)
- **All strategic:** Design is commodity (content/segmentation matters more)
- **All platform:** Switching cost is the barrier (migration + pricing)
- **Mixed:** No single dominant pain (segment is too broad OR early-stage)

**If Joltibase problem ranks:**
- **#1-2:** 🔥 Validated, build it
- **#3-5:** ⚠️ Important but not urgent, reposition or add higher-ranked problem
- **#6+:** 🚨 Wrong problem, pivot needed

---

## Next Steps

1. Choose 2-3 Joltibase statements (recommend: 1A + 1B)
2. Include all 11 peripheral statements
3. Copy into TypeForm/Google Forms
4. Randomize order
5. Add qualification questions
6. Launch and aim for 30+ qualified responses
7. Use `cpsr-analysis-guide.md` to interpret results

**Remember:** The goal is to learn the truth, not to validate your existing beliefs. If your problem ranks low, that's valuable data - not failure.

Good luck! 🚀
